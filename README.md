# Car-Data-Scrape

I have wrote a program (using only functions) that extracts data from a website.  I have also cleaned up the dataset for analysis and saved the file to csv.  The data is about cars and all the features of cars.

In the future, I want to study imputation methods and fill in the missing values.
